# Human Motion Analysis

* This repository contains code and experiments focused on analyzing human motion data. The primary objectives include filtering motion data and developing predictive models using machine learning techniques.
* For problem statement of motor alertness under darpa triage challenge phase 2

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `bandpass-experimentation/`: Contains experiments related to bandpass filtering of motion data.
- `filtering-experimentation/`: Includes various filtering techniques applied to the motion data.
- `lstm-experimentation/`: Focuses on experiments with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling and predicting human motion.
